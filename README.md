HDMI matrix switch control from arduino with ethernet shield

The 4x4 HDMI matrix switch from Sewell Direct uses normal sendNEC formats.
All of the control signals are in the software, but you have to send the 
key in your http GET because I could not get the variables to work correctly.

Any inputs would be most welcome, as I am not a web comms kind of guy.
